# Tilt-Brush

My personal Tilt Brush collection. It houses my .tilt files, models, and reference images.

You can copy anything directly, or you can check out this project in your Documents folder, backup your own `Tilt Brush` directory, and then rename this directory to `Tilt Brush` (just replace the - with a space).

Note that some of my .tilt files have objects and images referenced so if you don't have them also checked out in your Media Library, they won't appear when you load the .tilt file.
